# <p align="center">***PART 2: Applying Image Blurring Techniques***</p>

# I. Introduction
*<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image blurring* is a fundamental technique in computer vision used to soften image details, reduce noise, and create artistic effects. It plays a crucial role in preprocessing for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and feature extraction. For this project, the focus is on applying advanced blurring techniques to high-resolution images of Da Vinci paintings. These techniques aim to achieve creative bokeh effects that highlight certain aspects of the paintings while maintaining their artistic integrity. By exploring the application of Gaussian and median blurring methods, this project provides insights into both the aesthetic possibilities and computational implications of these techniques.</div> 

# II. Abstract
<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project explores various image blurring methods, including Gaussian blur and median blur, to enhance artistic details in Da Vinci paintings. The objective is to achieve creative bokeh effects while analyzing the impact of each method. The approach involves preprocessing high-resolution painting datasets, applying different blurring algorithms, and evaluating the results visually and quantitatively. Expected outcomes include insights into the artistic enhancement of paintings and the practical utility of blurring techniques in image processing.</div>
