# I. Introduction
*<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image blurring* is a fundamental technique in computer vision used to soften image details, reduce noise, and create artistic effects. It plays a crucial role in preprocessing for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and feature extraction. For this project, the focus is on applying advanced blurring techniques to high-resolution images of Da Vinci paintings. These techniques aim to achieve creative bokeh effects that highlight certain aspects of the paintings while maintaining their artistic integrity. By exploring the application of Gaussian and median blurring methods, this project provides insights into both the aesthetic possibilities and computational implications of these techniques.</div> 

# II. Abstract
<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project explores various image blurring methods, including Gaussian Blur and Median Blur, to enhance artistic details in Da Vinci paintings. The objective is to achieve creative bokeh effects while analyzing the impact of each method. The approach involves preprocessing high-resolution painting datasets, applying different blurring algorithms, and evaluating the results visually and quantitatively. Expected outcomes include insights into the artistic enhancement of paintings and the practical utility of blurring techniques in image processing.</div>


# III. Project Methods

Import Necessary Libraries
- Load essential Python Libraries

Da Vinci Paintings Image Folder
- Directory containing Da Vinci painting images

Load the Images
- List and ensure the only successfully loaded images are added to the images list.
- Load Images from dataset folder

Process the Images
- Apply OpenCV blurring techniques to every image

Specify the filename of the image to process
- Check if the target image exists in the folder

Display different blurring technique on the table (Original Image, Gaussian Blur, Median Blur)
- Original Image: Show the original painting image from the dataset.
- Gaussian Blur: Apply gaussian blur to the image and show the result
- Median Blur: Apply median blur to the image and show the result

# IV. Conclusion

<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has successfully implemented an automatic installation for applying and exhibiting different blurring techniques in images. With respect to processing a single image or all images in a particular folder, the application brings flexibility and scalability to different use cases. The results illustrate the efficiency of blur for changing detailed features of images, which could be effectively applied in areas such as privacy masking, noise reduction, and other artistic effects.</div> 

<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we used vscodes, we had to make adjustments because the provided video guide demonstrated openCv blurring techniques using Google Notebook. And because the video only demonstrated blurring techniques in a single image, we also encountered difficulties when dealing with a dataset.</div>  

<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach has been completed and is user-friendly as it provides a starting point for improvements required in the future. The project points the very useful Python tools such as Matplotlib and OpenCV for image processing jobs and stresses the importance of automation in the field.</div>
